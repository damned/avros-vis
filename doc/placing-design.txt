# design for placing objects

## rationale to using components to handle placement and linking

started moving to this as a reaction to trying to manage it all in higher level
"model" builder / construction code, but the testing is a bit painful due to
asynchronous concerns - having to wait for things to be loaded, rendered and known
both in layout and in asserting on the end state in tests.

moving to components allows higher level code to be tested independently as
annotating entities correctly, and lower level components can be tested with more
focus on them doing the right thing in dynamic situations.

this also fits with an a-frame ethos of using components and more generally with
a reasonably clear separation of concerns


## what should components look like / do?

have added a couple of obvious ones off the bat without an overall end design in sight:

1. *placement* - placing something *on* something else

obviously from the basic manual spiking this has an obvious use.

2. *edge* - on component from/to attributes specify edge to another thing


## open issues / concerns / questions

### supporting multiple tenants *on* a base

#### two evenly sized things on a base

<thing id="base">
<thing id="a" placement="on: #base">
<thing id="b" placement="on: #base">

1. base area is split evenly into two xz areas 
2. a and b are placed on the xz centres of their areas 
3. each ten

#### 



#### resizing co-tenants to give more space for their tenants

e.g. A and B share base, but there are a lot more tenants on B
therefore more space could be allocated to B to give more even overall spacing


### size of icon vs space taken up

e.g. put a server in a network, the network would probably have a lot of space - potentially
containing a small number of servers, but an auto-scaled server represented as a cube would
be relatively massive.

specifying width and depth limits is somewhat the aim (maybe works more for margins) but
would be simpler to work with a single height constraint - this also helps layers to be 
more practically stackable.

so maybe specify a max-height in a layer for consistency - maybe keep consistent between
subsequent layers (unless specifc override) to help with more consistency as more layers
added


### that gives a thought - detail opens up into upper layers

chimes well with the uppermost layers been most unobscured as you go into detail

there would naturally want to be some idea of expansion in those views, so x/z limits of
stacking would maybe want to be relaxed


### doman vs view vs display graphs - transformations all the way down

how much to fully embrace each level as a graph?

what does this mean for interactivity and dynamic behaviour?
