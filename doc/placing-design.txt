# design for placing objects

## rationale to using components to handle placement and linking

started moving to this as a reaction to trying to manage it all in higher level
"model" builder / construction code, but the testing is a bit painful due to
asynchronous concerns - having to wait for things to be loaded, rendered and known
both in layout and in asserting on the end state in tests.

moving to components allows higher level code to be tested independently as
annotating entities correctly, and lower level components can be tested with more
focus
