approach
[x] spike views manually
[x] aframe 1.3.0 upgrade
[.] aggressively improve test infrastructure
 - [x] test scene with optional scene clean/recreate vs re-use
 - [x] using independent world-space test roots, allowing for post-test move for review (makeViewable())
 - [x] add chai expectation(s) for matching entities under test to expected entities
 - [x] move between tests in post-testing visual review - '<' or '>' on desktop, 'A' in Quest
 - [x] lay out tests for review
 - [ ] resolve intermittent timeout issues, presumably from slow frames
   - [ ] instrument to determine cause - is it that a tick hasn't happened before action step?
   - [ ] if tick delay is cause, explicitly trigger actions off completion of tick - maybe tock() would help
 - [.] fix scene / root mismatch vs VR/controls (init'd in first scene)
   - [x] separate a-scene per Scene object
   - [.] fix au world space tests vs balloon label tests conflict - move to test roots
   - [ ] ensure hook up on enter vr on correct scene, wire keyboard into correct scene (at mo randoming around scenes)
 - [.] move all scene-based test to latest test scene / root usage
 - [.] lay out all tests and review improvements
   - [ ] de-conflict labelling of test objects
 - [ ] replay stages/actions and movements/changes to make sense of e.g. toucher tests
 - [ ] extract au.creata lib based on au.addEntityTo for cheapest creation syntax
   - [ ] possible syntax: builda.box({ at: '-2.25 0.75 -2.25', scale: 0.5 }).and.one.with({xz:'1 0'}) - needs single element and array duality
 - [ ] add a like/butWith/but.with for replicating entities with slight changes
 - [ ] extract squash lib - use shorthand for flat, x-flat, wall etc. scale / dimension modifiers
 - [.] auto-generation of test root offsets (pre / post test?) with defaulted optional bounds
 - [ ] mocha test runner page integration
   - [ ] keep scene viewable w/ pane for embedded scene
   - [ ] bring test root into view for test (when click on it / hover?)
 - [ ] onceLoaded improvements - let test scene / root track entities and provide ability to run code once loaded 
 - [ ] review code in visual review
[.] move to test-drive for functionality
 - [x] basic model boards / panels
 - [x] move to things and render with styles
 - [ ] move to low level components to allow simpler testing / construction at model level
   - [x] place single thing on
   - [x] single edge from
   - [x] single edge to
   - [x] multiple edges
   - [x] edges between spaces - scales and offsets
   - [x] split setup / it trial - didn't really need as yet - can generally set resetSceneBeforeEach to false
         as setup of each test overrides previous, but should use reset true when changing...
   - [x] place multiple things on, centred - unspecified order
   - [x] factor out functions to get positions of one object relative to another, regardless of components etc.
     - [x] include visual debug
   - [x] place on across scaled entities
   - [x] place multiple things on, constraining x and z
   - [x] place multiple things on non-unit objects (fixing 6 on es issues)
   - [x] allow specify margins for placed entities
     - [x] specified as % of constraint size, currently only in x
   - [ ] make constrain limit not target size (i.e. scale down to but not up)
   - [ ] switch placement on to use size constraint by default
   - [ ] auto-stretch for placed entities (e.g. subnets)
   - [ ] multi-segment edges (squared)
   - [ ] place on multiple entities - specify order
 - [.] allow user interaction - re-use vr-builder components
   - [x] hands
   - [x] self-move
   - [x] allow grab-move hard-positioned base
     - [x] spike with placements updating to new position at end
     - [ ] backfill tests for update on moveend
     - [.] trigger other relevant updates
       - [.] update edge positions
   - [ ] move vr-builder components into project with tests and removal of jquery
     - [ ] hand.js
     - [x] grabber.js
     - [x] toucher.js
     - [ ] user-mover.js
     - [x] follower.js and follower-constraint
     - [ ] etc.
   - [ ] placement on base when grab-move object onto base
 - [ ] refactor model to use placement components
 - [ ] add onto existing entities
 - [ ] connectors
 - [ ] start building out current model
 - [ ] move to things and styles?
[ ] move from avr-os
  - [x] rename to generic: tilt-viz for table-top viz a la tilt-five
  - [ ] to new subject for main graph, from:
    - dogfood code?
    - infra?
    - simple and build up?
