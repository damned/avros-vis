refac to things


approach
[x] spike views manually
[.] aggressively improve test infrastructure
 - [x] test scene with optional scene clean/recreate vs re-use
 - [x] using independent world-space test roots, allowing for post-test move for review (makeViewable())
 - [ ] extract au.creator lib based on au.addEntityTo for cheapest creation syntax
 - [ ] auto-generation of test root offsets (pre / post test?) with defaulted optional bounds
 - [ ] lay out tests for review
 - [ ] move all scene-based test to latest test scene / root usage
 - [ ] lay out all tests and review
 - [ ] mocha test runner page integration
   - [ ] keep scene viewable w/ pane for embedded scene
   - [ ] bring test root into view for test (when click on it / hover?)
[.] move to test-drive for functionality
 - [x] basic model boards / panels
 - [x] move to things and render with styles
 - [ ] move to low level components to allow simpler testing / construction at model level
   - [x] place single thing on
   - [x] single edge from
   - [x] single edge to
   - [x] multiple edges
   - [x] edges between spaces - scales and offsets
   - [x] split setup / it trial - didn't really need as yet - can generally set resetSceneBeforeEach to false
         as setup of each test overrides previous, but should use reset true when changing...
   - [x] place multiple things on, centred - unspecified order
   - [x] factor out functions to get positions of one object relative to another, regardless of components etc.
     - [x] include visual debug
   - [x] place on across scaled entities
   - [.] place multiple things on, constraining x and z
   - [ ] multi-segment edges (squared)
   - [ ] place on multiple entities - specify order
 - [ ] refactor model to use placement components
 - [ ] add onto existing entities
 - [ ] connectors
 - [ ] start building out current model
 - [ ] move to things and styles?

completeness
[x] tasks
[x] tr forest
[x] services
[x] req - fus
[ ] tg
[ ] lam scaleup - tower
[ ] many tr trees
[ ] azs

labelling
[ ] icons
[ ] rotate to viewer
[ ] circulators


flows
[ ] flow along edges, showing direction
[ ] stop and start (opacity)
[ ] daily sequence
[ ] clock


stages
[ ] two stages
[ ] switch between stages


details
[ ] magnify glass
[ ] doc lines
[ ] doc parts
[ ] switch been focus / scale
[ ] occlude others


interaction
[ ] pull up/out
[ ] drag around
[ ] sleeves
[ ] fade / highlight - e.g. req/ing


progression
[ ] animate item position between stages


privacy
[x] shorts
[ ] server render
[ ] data map from param key

pipelines
[ ]

testing
[ ] if split setup/it works, focus on related entities after failure
